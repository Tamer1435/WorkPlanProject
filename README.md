# WorkPlan

## Project Development

- Anas Shwiki
- Tamer Dabit

## Description

WorkPlan is a react-native application for Android and iOS, it was made to help an agricultural school with their job planning and sharing the dates
with their staff and students. It helps the management with keeping all the information of each job in a reachable environment thats simple and secure,
it also allows them to export said data in the form of an Excel file to help them access and save the data on other devices and storage units.

## Database

The app integrates with Firebase Firestore as the primary database to store and retrieve real-time data, ensuring efficient data synchronization across different pages and users. Here's how the database connection works:

1. **Firebase Firestore Setup**

   - The app is connected to Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database. Firestore allows for real-time data syncing, which is crucial for environments where multiple users interact with the same data simultaneously.

   - Firestore Configuration: The Firebase configuration is stored in a secure file, named firebase-config.js.

2. **Real-Time Data Interaction**

   - Fetching Data: The app queries Firestore to dynamically fetch data such as attendance records, job assignments, or user availability. This allows for real-time updates based on user interactions.

   - Data Storage: The app uses Firestore to store key information including:

     - Users' info
     - Attendance records
     - Job assignments (Calendar)
     - Staff and student availability
     - Reports and feedback

   - Real-Time Updates: Firestore ensures that changes made by users, such as submitting reports or setting availability, are instantly reflected across all devices connected to the app.

3. **Connecting the App to Firebase**

   - The connection to Firestore is managed using the Firebase SDK, which is initialized in the app using configurations from the firebaseConfig.js file.

   - Data Operations: The app interacts with the Firestore database to:

     - Read data (from collections like "calendar", "attendance", "jobs", "students")
     - Write new data
     - Update existing data

4. **Security and Authentication**

   - Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication handles user logins securely, allowing users to authenticate with their email and password.

   - Role-Based Access: The app uses Firebase security rules to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., teachers, students, administrators). This ensures that users can only access data relevant to their role.

   - Security Rules: Firestore security rules are set up to control who can read or write specific data, ensuring sensitive information is protected.

## Database Structure

The app uses Firebase Firestore as its database. Below is an overview of the Firestore database collections and documents used in the project.

1. ### Users Collection (users)

## How to Connect a New Firebase Firestore Database

If you're setting up a new Firebase Firestore database and want to connect it to the existing app, follow these steps:

1.  ### Create a Firebase Project

    - Go to the Firebase Console.
    - Create a new Firebase project or select an existing project.
    - Enable Firestore in the Firebase console under the "Build" section by clicking on - Firestore Database and setting it up in your preferred mode (Test or Production).

2.  ### Add users to Authentication for testing

    - Go to the Firebase Console / Authentication.
    - Enable authenticate by email and password.
    - Add a user with email and password.
    - Copy the generated uid.
    - Go to Firebase Console / Firestore.
    - Make a collection of users.
    - Add a document and paste the uid as the document id.
    - Add a name, email and role for the user (manager, teacher or student).

3.  ### Add Your App to Firebase

    In the Firebase console, add your app by selecting Web as the platform.
    Firebase will provide a unique configuration snippet. This includes information like the API key, project ID, and database URL.

4.  ### Create Firebase Configuration File

    In your project folder, create a file (if it doesn’t already exist) named firebase-config.js.
    This file will store your Firebase credentials. The structure should include the following keys:
    API Key
    Auth Domain
    Project ID
    Storage Bucket
    Messaging Sender ID
    App ID

    sample code:

        // firebaseConfig.js

        const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "AIzaSyD-ExampleApiKey-12345",
        authDomain: "your-app-name.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "your-app-id",
        storageBucket: "your-app-name.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
        appId: "1:123456789012:web:example12345abcde",
        measurementId: "G-EXAMPL1234"
        };

        export default firebaseConfig;

5.  ### Initialize Firebase in the App

    In your main app file (e.g., App.js or index.js), import the Firebase configuration from firebaseConfig.js.
    Initialize Firebase using the Firebase SDK and the configuration object exported from firebaseConfig.js.
    Make sure to initialize Firestore within the Firebase setup.

6.  ### Update Firebase SDK Dependencies

    Ensure that your app has the necessary Firebase SDK dependencies in your package.json. The required Firebase SDK modules may include:
    firebase/app
    firebase/firestore
    firebase/auth
    You can install them by running:

        npm install firebase

7.  ### Connect Firestore to Your Pages

    In each of the relevant pages that interact with the database (such as AttendancePage.js, SetJobsPage.js, etc.), ensure that Firestore functions for reading and writing data are properly connected to your Firestore instance.

    When fetching data or saving data, ensure that Firestore references match your new database's collections and document structure. For instance, if your Firestore structure has collections like users, jobs, or attendance, ensure these are correctly referenced.

8.  ### Setup Firebase Security Rules
    In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and click on Rules.
    Set up security rules to control access to your data. Ensure only authenticated users with appropriate roles (e.g., students, teachers, admins) can access or modify specific data.
9.  ### Test the Connection
    After connecting the new Firestore database, run the app and check if data is being fetched and stored properly.
    Verify that Firestore is receiving and updating data as expected by viewing collections in the Firestore console.

## Firebase Authentication Setup: AuthProvider

To handle authentication in the app, we use Firebase Authentication, which allows us to manage user logins, signups, and sessions. The AuthProvider.js file plays a crucial role in this process, acting as a central context provider for user authentication.

1.  ### Location of the AuthProvider.js File

    The AuthProvider.js file is typically located in the app directory. This file is responsible for providing the authentication state and functions to the entire app using React's Context API.

2.  ### Role of AuthProvider.js

    This file manages the current user's authentication state across the app, including:
    **Login**: Handles user sign-in with email and password or other methods (like Google).
    **Signup**: Manages new user registration.
    **Logout**: Allows users to securely log out.
    **Session Management**: Keeps track of the authenticated user session using Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener.

    The AuthProvider component wraps the app and provides authentication data (e.g., user info) and methods (e.g., sign in, sign out) to child components.

3.  ### Steps to Use a New Firebase Authentication Setup

    If you're connecting a new Firebase Authentication setup, here's what you need to do:

    **Update Firebase Configuration in firebaseConfig.js**

    Make sure the Firebase project you're connecting to has Authentication enabled.
    Add the Firebase Auth configuration (it’s usually included when you initialize Firebase in firebaseConfig.js).

    **Modify AuthProvider.js to Use New Firebase Project**

    In AuthProvider.js, ensure that the Firebase instance being used for authentication matches the new Firebase project.
    The relevant Firebase methods, like signInWithEmailAndPassword, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, onAuthStateChanged, etc., should work with the Firebase configuration from firebaseConfig.js.

    **Ensure Firebase Auth SDK is Installed**

    If it’s not already installed, make sure you have the Firebase Auth module by running:

         npm install firebase

    **Review Auth-Related Pages**

    Check that the authentication logic is correctly implemented in pages like:
    LoginPage.js
    SignupPage.js
    ProfilePage.js

    These pages will interact with the authentication context provided by AuthProvider.js.

4.  ### Key Methods in AuthProvider.js

    Sign Up: Allows users to create a new account using Firebase Authentication.
    Sign In: Authenticates users using Firebase’s authentication methods (email/password, Google, etc.).
    Sign Out: Logs the user out and clears session data.
    Get Current User: Returns the currently signed-in user or null if no user is logged in.
    Session Persistence: Uses Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener to maintain user login status across sessions.

5.  ### Connecting Auth to Firestore

    The authenticated user information (such as user ID) can be linked to the Firestore database to store user-specific data (like profiles, preferences, or activity history).
    Use Firebase Auth's user.uid in Firestore to create or fetch user-specific documents (e.g., users/{userID}).
